05/08/23 : started annotating tutorial code + experimenting
18/08/23 : created particle and line
21/08/23 : turned line into arrow and cleaned up code
23/08/23 : created path method and main running code (all i have left is findAngle method)
05/09/23 : created findAngle method (took a long time) and fixed other issues due to order of some lines (some code can't work in running loop and needs to b outside)


Steps for next time:
- add boundaries
- check angles for angle finding in diff quadrants
- add bouncing? restitution equations maybe?

notes:
- don't define variables for suvat in the buttondown check do it in 'if projected' loop instead so its all together XX CAN"T DO THIS BC IT UPDATES
- most confusing thing ever is that the y coordinates start at 0 from the top, ie, top left is 0,0

Things to do:
- analysis
- move targets
- add timer
- add air resistance?
- clean up code
- nicer gui
- options for different environments --> dropdown menu
- SCREENSAVER?

useful things I've found:
- math.atan2(y,x) gives the arctan of y/x but it considers the signs of y and x which is useful for direction :)
- making constants for colours actually saves so much time in the long run




***scrap obstacles and add sliders instead***







find out how many bounces needed for it to stop
